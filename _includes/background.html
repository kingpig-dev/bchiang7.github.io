      Currently, I'm an Engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.upstatement.com/" target="_blank">Upstatement</a> working on web projects for our awesome clients. Prior to Upstatement, I recently graduated from
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a> with my bachelor's degree after completing three wonderful six-month co-ops at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://us.mullenlowe.com/" target="_blank">MullenLowe U.S.</a>,
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>, and
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/music/" target="_blank">Apple Music</a>.

    <p>As a front-end engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.</p>

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.</p>
